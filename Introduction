Introduction


During Covid-19 between February and June 2020 I devoted nearly 6-8 hours per day (at the minimum) almost every single day to learning the fundamentals of programming to
set myself up for a long term career in computer science.  My entire life leading up to this has revolved around computers and technology and I have finally made the 
choice to make it my life's work.  I have a bachelors degree from Academy of Art University San Francisco in Animation and Visual Effects, I loved my time in the art world 
and yet I wish to do more with my life to push humanity forward through technology.  Enrolling in the OSSU curriculum is equivalent to obtaining another Bachelors degree, 
this time in Computer Science.  To prepare myself for this undertaking I have spent the past months completing various exercises on phone apps (M1m0, Sololearn, Enki), I have
jumped head first into various small projects (Discord bots, Unity video game dev), I have taken two courses in person at Golden West College California (C++, Introduction
to computer science), I have read multiple books and nearly every online resource I can get ahold of, and I have fully immersed myself in the programming world by building
myself up to the chanllenge of finally going "professional" by making a github with the commitment of near daily coding every day and working through this OSSU course
with the goal of finding my first job in computers within one year and continuing to better myself as a programmer for the rest of my life.

Up until today I have kept a loose log of my hours which I plan to make public here over the next few days.  Today marks the transition period as I go from loosely keeping
track of those daily hours to instead keeping a near exact record of my time as I go from zero to mastery over this difficult subject.  My hope is that this journey will
inspire those around me and serve as proof of my devotion and hard work.  It is going to be a grind.  Enjoy the show.
